# Animations Showcase

This repository contains HTML and CSS code for a webpage showcasing 20 different animations applied to various blocks.

## Description

The HTML file (`index.html`) consists of a structure that includes a header, main section with animations, and a basic footer. Within the main section, there are 20 div blocks labeled from Animation 1 to Animation 20.

The CSS file (`styles.css`) defines styles for the layout, including common styles for the body, header, navigation, and animations. Additionally, it contains animation definitions using keyframes for each animation class from `.animation1` to `.animation20`.

## Usage

To view the animations:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Hover over each block to trigger the specific animation applied to it. Feel free to explore the CSS file to understand how each animation is defined and applied.

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for additional animations or improvements to the existing code, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and create a pull request.
